We propose to study the novel task of ‘panoptic segmentation forecasting’: given a set of observed frames, the goal is to forecast the panoptic segmentation for a set of unobserved frames. We also propose a first approach to forecasting future panoptic segmentations. In contrast to typical semantic forecasting, we model the motion of individual object instances and the background separately. This makes instance information persistent during forecasting, and allows us to understand the motion of each moving object.
